Hi there, I'm Shyam Thandullu. I'm currently a high school junior taking AP Computer Science A. 
I also participate in coding competitions and I'm always looking for the next coding concept to learn.
At the moment I code exclusively in java but I am also interested in learning python down the line (maybe this summer? :D)
